# ✈️ Business Class Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Business Class passenger satisfaction using a real-world airline passenger dataset. The goal is to uncover insights that can help improve the customer experience through data-driven decisions.

## 📁 Dataset Description

Each row in the dataset represents an individual airline passenger. The dataset includes:
- **Demographic information** (e.g., Gender, Age)
- **Flight-related details** (e.g., Class, Flight Distance, delays)
- **Satisfaction ratings** for various services (on a scale from 1 to 5)

## 📌 Project Tasks

### 1. Business Class Satisfaction Analysis
- Filtered the data to include only passengers with `Class = Business`.
- Calculated average satisfaction scores for key services such as:
  - Seat comfort
  - Cleanliness
  - Inflight wifi service
  - On-board service
  - Food and drink
- Identified the highest and lowest scoring criteria.

### 2. Satisfaction Map Visualization
- Created a satisfaction map using bar charts and heatmaps.
- Compared service categories to highlight strengths and weaknesses.

### 3. Flight Distance vs. Class Analysis
- Calculated average `Flight Distance` for each passenger class.
- Used pivot tables and boxplots to visualize which class travels longer distances.

### 4. Satisfaction by Age and Gender
- Grouped passengers into 10-year age brackets.
- Analyzed average scores for selected services (`Seat comfort`, `Inflight wifi service`, `Cleanliness`, `On-board service`) based on `Age` and `Gender`.
- Presented findings using pivot tables and visualizations.

### 5. Identifying Lowest Scores and Strategy Development
- Found the 3 lowest satisfaction areas based on age and gender segments.
- Proposed actionable recommendations for improvement.

### 6. Time Convenience vs. Distance and Delays
- Investigated the relationship between `Departure/Arrival time convenient` and:
  - Flight Distance
  - Departure Delay in Minutes
  - Arrival Delay in Minutes
- Used scatter plots and pivot charts to support the analysis.

### 7. Seat Comfort vs. Distance and Delays
- Explored how `Seat comfort` is affected by flight distance and delays.
- Supported with visual analysis using scatter plots and tables.
